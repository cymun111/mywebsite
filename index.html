   <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, My name is Kenyon Westbrook, I have always wanted to learn to code and write my own programs. I have always been fascinated by technology, especially computers. I love to learn new things and find out how things work, I was the kind of child that took his Discman apart to find out how it worked rather than just listening to the music. I love to solve puzzles, riddles, and anything logic based. I honestly enjoy programming, because of the challenge and because others look at a programming language and see chicken scratch, gibberish or hieroglyphs and I love being able to understand it.</p>
   <h1>My Background</h1>
    <p>I am from Arizona, I have lived here my whole life. I was born in a small town called Pinetop/Lakeside, although I do not enjoy small towns. I moved to Mesa when I was 18 years old, and I loved it here despite the heat. I have worked many jobs but mostly construction as that was my first working experience and it kind of stuck with me. In the last 5 years I have Served a full time mission in Chile, Learned Spanish in the process, taught English as a second language and worked in customer service.</p>
   <h1>Why I Decided to learn Programing</h1>
    <p>I decided to get serious about improving and expanding my knowledge in Programming for many reasons, some of which are:</p>
